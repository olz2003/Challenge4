# Challenge4

## Description

Challenge4 is a coding quiz designed to help users prepare for coding assessments often encountered during interviews or as part of coding education.

### What does this project do?
The primary purpose of this project is to create a coding quiz that assesses knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. It offers a timed quiz experience with multiple-choice questions and provides a feature to store high scores.

### What did I learn?
This project allowed me to understand how to implement timers and handle time-based events in JavaScript. I developed skills in validating user input to ensure the accuracy of quiz assessments. I learned how to store and retrieve data locally in the browser to track and display high scores. By creating this quiz, I built a tool that provides an engaging experience for users interested in testing their JavaScript knowledge.
